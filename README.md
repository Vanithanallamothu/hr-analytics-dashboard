# HR Analytics Dashboard Project

This project explores employee attrition, salary trends, and workforce dynamics using a real-world HR dataset. SQL was used for data exploration, and Tableau was used to create interactive dashboards for insightful visualizations. The goal is to understand factors influencing employee turnover, retention, and compensation trends.
